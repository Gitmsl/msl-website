            <p className='aboutText'>Hi, I'm Mike! I'm a PoliSci grad-turned self-taught software 
            engineer from Southern California. I have a strong passion for education and mentorship
            fostered by my time spent both learning and teaching at the University of California, Riverside;
            passions that have proven valuable over the course of my transition towards a career in tech.
            I've always had a passion for technology, having been raised on videogames and the early 
            years of social media and the internet. I'm excited to join a group of fellow 
            developers eager learn, grow, and provide value to their team. </p>
            <p className='aboutText'>You can find the links to my LinkedIn and Github accounts above, 
            as well as my current email address. I'm always happy to hear feedback, advice, or if you 
            think I'd be a great fit for your team! Can't wait to connect!</p>
