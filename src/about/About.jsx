            <p>Michael graduated from the University of California, Riverside with
             a degree in Political Science in 2018, with plans to take a year or two
             off before returning to higher-ed to pursue a PhD with the goal of
             becoming a college professor. A few years and a global pandemic later, 
             Michael re-evaluated his life plans, and began his journey to become
             a self-taught software developer in 2021. Now, nearly half-way through 
             2022, Michael is excited at the prospect of joining a team of fellow
              developers eager and ready to identify and solve problems big and small. </p>
